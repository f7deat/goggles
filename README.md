for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [HTML] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [CSS] - awesome web-based text editor
- [Markdown] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [Tailwindcss] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [Javascript] - evented I/O for the backend

## Installation
